Software Engineering Day1 Assignment

#Part 1: Introduction to Software Engineering

Explain what software engineering is and discuss its importance in the technology industry.
Software engineering is the process of designing, developing, testing, and maintaining software systems using
engineering principles. Software engineering ensures that software systems are efficient, reliable, scalable
and maintainable.

Identify and describe at least three key milestones in the evolution of software engineering.
The evolution of software engineering has gone through several key milestones, shaping modern software development.
First software programs were manually written in machine language Binary , Assembly Language was introduced to simplify programming.
1968 NATO Software Engineering Conference emphasized the need for systematic development methods and structured programming emerged,
Promoting modular and readable code (e.g., Pascal, C).
Introduction of Waterfall Model ( first formal software development process).
Agile and internet era, iterative and flexible development approaches.

List and briefly explain the phases of the Software Development Life Cycle.
Planning - Defines the project scope, objectives and feasibility, estimates cost, time, and resources.
Requirements Analysis - Gathers and documents user needs and expectations, identifies functional and non-functional requirements.
Design - Creates the architecture and system design ( UI, database, system flow), ensures scalability, security and performance considerations.
Implementation(Coding) - Developers write and compile the actual code based on design specifications, users programming languages framework, and development tools.
Testing - Identifies and fixes bugs through various testing methods, ensures the software meets requirements and performs correctly.
Deployment - Software is released to users or production environments, which may involve beta testing.
Maintenance and updates - Fixes bugs, updates features, and improves security and ensures software remains functional as technology evolves.


Compare and contrast the Waterfall and Agile methodologies. Provide examples of scenarios where each would be appropriate.
Waterfall is suitable for projects with clear, stable requirements and strict regulatory compliance. eg Banking or financial software, Military and aerospace projects.
Agile works best for fast-changing environment where user feedback is essential, eg Mobile apps or web applications, startups developing new software and e-commerce platforms.

Describe the roles and responsibilities of a Software Developer, a Quality Assurance Engineer, and a Project Manager in a software engineering team.
Software Deve


Discuss the importance of Integrated Development Environments (IDEs) and Version Control Systems (VCS) in the software development process. Give examples of each.


What are some common challenges faced by software engineers? Provide strategies to overcome these challenges.


Explain the different types of testing (unit, integration, system, and acceptance) and their importance in software quality assurance.


#Part 2: Introduction to AI and Prompt Engineering


Define prompt engineering and discuss its importance in interacting with AI models.


Provide an example of a vague prompt and then improve it by making it clear, specific, and concise. Explain why the improved prompt is more effective.
